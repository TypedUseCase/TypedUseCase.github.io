## Lifeline
> Life line is the execution of the [**Initiator**](/domain/#initiator).

* It **may** contain other use-case parts, indented by one level.
* It _activates_ an Initiator and _deactivates_ it, in the end of a lifeline.

### Syntax
```tuc
{InitiatorService}
    // indented execution of the lifeline
```

### Example
```fs
// myDomain.fsx

type MainService = Initiator
```

```tuc
tuc Lifeline
participants
    MainService My as "Main Service"

MainService
    "this is a lifeline"
```

Results:

![lifeline.svg](/tuc/examples/lifeline.svg)

```puml
@startuml lifeline

== Lifeline ==

actor "Main Service" as MainService <<My>>

activate MainService
note over MainService: this is a lifeline

deactivate MainService

@enduml
```

## Section
> It is a simple divider in the puml.

* It **must not** be indented (_so it **can not** be in any execution, body, etc._)
* It **must** have a name

### Syntax
```tuc
section {Section name}
```

### Example
```tuc
tuc Section
participants
    MainService My as "Main Service"

section There is just a section
```

Results:

![section.svg](/tuc/examples/section.svg)

```puml
@startuml section

== Section ==

actor "Main Service" as MainService <<My>>

activate MainService

== There is just a section ==


deactivate MainService

@enduml
```

## Service Method Call
> It is the execution of the Service Method by a _caller_.

* It **must** be in the execution of another _caller_ (_lifeline, other method call, etc._)
* It **may** contain other use-case parts, indented by one level.
* It _activates_ a Service and _deactivates_ it, in the end of an execution, returning a Method's return value to the _caller_.

### Syntax
```tuc
{ServiceName}.{MethodName}
    // indented execution of the method
```

Service Type is found in the Domain Types, it must contain a MethodName as a field with a function (_method_). The type of the Method is used in the puml.

**NOTE**: Service will became a _caller_ in its execution body.

### Example
```fs
// myDomain.fsx

type MainService = Initiator

type Service = {
    Method: Input -> Output
}

and Input = Input
and Output = Output
```

```tuc
tuc Service Method Call
participants
    MainService My as "Main Service"
    Service My

MainService                             // MainService is the caller
    Service.Method                      // Method `Method` is called on the `Service`
        "this is part of execution"     // This is part of the Method execution

    Service.MethodWithMoreArgs          // Method `MethodWithMoreArgs` is called on the `Service`
        "this is part of execution"     // This is part of the Method execution
```

* It **must** be in the execution of another _caller_ (_lifeline, other method call, etc._)
* It **can not** contain other use-case parts.
* It validates you are sending a correct data type to the correct Data Object.

    InteractionEvent.Confirmed -> [InteractionCache]

    InteractionEvent.Rejected -> [InteractionCache]
    InteractionEvent.Rejected.Expired -> [InteractionCache]
    InteractionEvent.Rejected.Rejected -> [InteractionCache]
```

Results:

## Handle Event In Stream
> It is the execution of the Service Handler, invoked by an Stream Event..

* It **must** start after a Stream name, indented by one level.
* It **may** contain other use-case parts, indented by one level.
* It _activates_ a Service and _deactivates_ it, in the end of an execution, returning _nothing_ to the _caller_.

### Syntax
```tuc
[{TypeName}Stream]
    {ServiceName}.{HandlerName}
        // indented execution of the method
```

Service Type is found in the Domain Types, it must contain a HandlerName as a field with a function (_[handler](/domain/#handler)_). The type of the Handler is used for checking a Stream Type.

**NOTE**: Service will became a _caller_ in its execution body.

### Example
```fs
// myDomain.fsx

// common types
type Stream<'Event> = Stream of 'Event list
type StreamHandler<'Event> = StreamHandler of ('Event -> unit)

// domain types
type InteractionStream = InteractionStream of Stream<InteractionEvent>

and InteractionEvent =
    | Confirmed of ConfirmedEvent
    | Rejected of RejectedEvent

and ConfirmedEvent = ConfirmedEvent

and RejectedEvent =
    | Expired
    | Rejected

type StreamListener = {
    OnInteractionEvent: StreamHandler<InteractionEvent>
}
```

```tuc
tuc Handle Event in Stream
participants
    StreamListener My
    [InteractionStream] My

[InteractionStream]                     // Stream of the Event type of the handler
    StreamListener.OnInteractionEvent   // Handler `OnInteractionEvent` is called on the `StreamListener`
        "this is part of execution"     // This is part of the Handler execution
```

    deactivate StreamListener

```

## Group
> Allows to group use-case parts together.

* It **may** be indented (_so it **can** be in any execution, body, etc._)
* It **must** have a name
* It **must** contain at least one use-case part, indented by one level.

### Syntax
```tuc
group {Group name}
    // indented body of the group
```

### Example
```tuc
tuc Group
participants
    MainService My as "Main Service"

group Grouped together
    MainService
        do something

    MainService
        do something else

@enduml
```

## If
> Allows to group use-case parts together by a condition.

* It **may** be indented (_so it **can** be in any execution, body, etc._)
* It **must** have a condition
* It **must** contain at least one use-case part, indented by one level.
* It **may** have an `else` branch, when it does, it **must** be on the same level as is the `if`. And `else` **must** contain at least one use-case part, indented by one level.

### Syntax
```tuc
if {Condition}
    // indented body of the if
```

With `else`
```tuc
if {Condition}
    // indented body of the if
else
    // indented body of the else
```

**NOTE**: There is no `else if` syntax, if you need to use it, you need to have other `if/if-else` in the `else` branch.

With another `if` in `else`
```tuc
if {Condition}
    // indented body of the if
else
    if {Condition}
        // indented body of the else-if
```

### Example
```tuc
tuc If-else
participants
    MainService My as "Main Service"

    MainService
        if it is over a 30°C
